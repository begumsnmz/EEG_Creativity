This script takes the pre-processed data and applies alpha-power analysis, using the MATLAB function pwelch with the following parameters:

*srate = sampling rate of the EEG signal = 250 Hz*
NOVERLAP = 0; %amount of overlap between windows
NFFT = srate; %number of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) points
WINDOW = srate; %Size of Hamming Window
[spectra,freqs] = pwelch(dataset(ch,:),WINDOW*2,NOVERLAP, NFFT, srate);

From the spectra produces, the script extracts these wavebands of interest:
- delta = 1-4 Hz
- theta = 4-8 Hz
- beta = 13-30 Hz
- gamma = 30-80 Hz

- Alpha1 = 8-13 Hz
- Alpha2 = 7.5-12.5 Hz
- Alpha3 = 7.5-10 Hz
- Alpha4 = 10-12.5 Hz
- Alpha5 (referred to in the script as lowAlpha) = 8-10 Hz
- Alpha6 (referred to in the the script as highAlpha) = 10-13 Hz

Finally, the log mean power is calculated for all intervals
*The power analysis is done for each subject, condition and channel separately.
