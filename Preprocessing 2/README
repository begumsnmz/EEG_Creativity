The scripts here take the final output of "Preprocessing 1" and are run in the following order:

1. eeglab_subepoching_autrej
2. eeglab_uniform_cut

1. eeglab_sub_epoching_autrej: The EEG data, now comprising of two epochs, is further segmented into 200ms sub-epochs, with a total of 1200 epochs (600 per condition) 
for the 4 minute total recording. 
This sub-epoching is not included in the script, since it was done for different groups/subjects manually. Instead, the resulting eventslists for each group/subject
are loaded into the script and are used to segment the data of the respective subjects belonging to the groups.

After the sub-epoching the data is again separated into eyes-closed/eyes-open conditions (first and last 600 epochs, respectively)
Then these epochs are rejected with respect to kurtosis of activity with a SD threshold of 6.

Afterwards, the eyes-closed and eyes-open data are saved in separate files for further processing.

2. eeglab_uniform_cut: Takes the output of the previous script. The automatic rejection of epochs keeps different amounts of data per subject, and this is not desirable
for further spectral and statistical analysis. Therefore, here, the minimum number of epochs (n) is determined across all subjects and for both conditions, and the
number of epochs is taken as the first n epochs for all subjects/conditions to achieve uniform data length.
